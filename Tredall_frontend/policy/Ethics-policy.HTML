<h1>Ethics Policy</h1>


<p>A company's code of ethics gives employees guidance on business matters, including those of the board of directors and executive officers. Dow Jones own code of ethics states, "The central premise of this code is that Dow Jones' reputation for quality products and services, for business integrity, and for the independence and integrity of our publications, services and products is the heart and soul of our enterprise. Put another way, it is an essential prerequisite for success in the news and information business that our customers believe us to be telling them the truth. If we are not telling them the truth—or even if they, for any valid reason, believe that we are not—then Dow Jones cannot prosper. "</p>
